He does not view projects as collections of features; he views them as
architectures that must scale, evolve, and remain maintainable.

Core traits in engineering:

- Breaks complex problems into structured modules
- Designs logic before writing code
- Thinks about edge cases early
- Values clean architecture
- Prefers production-oriented implementations over demo builds
- Believes AI systems must be designed responsibly and intelligently

He is particularly interested in:
- Artificial Intelligence systems
- Generative AI
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
